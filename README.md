MATLAB implementation of a 3D direct positioning algorithm featuring dynamic grid adaptation for enhanced indoor localization accuracy.

## Key Features
- **Direct Positioning**: integrating AOA-TOA features
- **Adaptive Gird Refinement**: Automatic grid refinement from 1.0m-level to 0.1m-level resolution
- **Signal Support**: Processes Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) input

## Experimental Indoor Scenarios
### Breakroom Environment (8m × 6.5m × 3m)
![Office Scenario](docs/Snapshot_of_Breakroom.png)
- **Anchor Configuration**: 5 BLE anchors
- **Obstacles**: cabinets, glass, walls

### Anterroom Environment (10m × 4m × 3m)
![Parking Scenario](docs/Snapshot_of_Anterroom.png)
- **Anchor Configuration**: 4 BLE anchors

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- MATLAB R2023a or later
